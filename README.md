# senitiment-react

 I have used react along with a npm package called sentiment to create this application.
 
 You can install it by typing: npm install sentiment
 
 After creating your own react app to understand everything clearly.
 Node_modules folder is missing because it contains many files and hence couldn't upload 
 
 The program works successfully.
 There is also a screenshot attached
